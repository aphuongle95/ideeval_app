# Project Plan: On-Device AI Chat Application

This document summarizes the key decisions and technical strategy for building the private, on-device AI chat application.

## 1. Core Objective

The primary goal is to create a mobile chat application that runs a Large Language Model (LLM) entirely on the user's device. The highest priority is achieving maximum **performance**, defined by:

*   **Quality:** The ability to run a powerful, high-quality model.
*   **Latency:** The fastest possible response time from the AI.

## 2. Platform and Technology Strategy

To meet the performance objective, the project will proceed with **native application development**.

*   **Initial Focus:** The project will begin with an **iOS-only application**.
*   **Core Technologies:**
    *   **Language:** Swift
    *   **UI Framework:** SwiftUI
    *   **AI/ML Framework:** Core ML

This native iOS approach was chosen over cross-platform options (Flutter, Web Apps) because it provides direct access to Apple's hardware accelerators (like the Neural Engine), which is essential for optimal AI performance.

## 3. Model Deployment Strategy

The AI model will be handled as follows:

*   **Delivery Method:** The model will be **downloaded on the first launch** of the application.
*   **Rationale:** This strategy keeps the initial App Store download size manageable. The trade-off is a one-time setup process for the user upon first use.

## 4. Acknowledged Obstacles

The most significant technical challenges are anticipated in the following areas:

*   **Model Compression:** Finding the right balance between reducing the model's size (via techniques like quantization) and maintaining its conversational quality.
*   **On-Device Resource Management:** Carefully managing the app's RAM and battery consumption to ensure a smooth user experience.
*   **Hardware Optimization:** Fully leveraging Apple's Core ML and Neural Engine to get the best possible inference speed.
