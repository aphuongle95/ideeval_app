# Swift/iOS Best Practices

- Use Xcode workspaces and organize code in groups/folders by feature or layer.
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines and use descriptive naming.
- Use `let` by default, `var` only when necessary.
- Leverage Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods for dependency management.
- Store secrets and API keys securely (never in code or Info.plist).
- Keep assets organized in `Assets.xcassets` and use asset catalogs.
- Write unit/UI tests and keep them in `*Tests` and `*UITests` folders.
- Clean up build artifacts and caches regularly.
- Document all experiments, findings, and failed attempts in a `research/` or `logs/` folder.
